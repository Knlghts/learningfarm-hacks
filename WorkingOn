// Noting these things for auto answer (coming soon maybe)?
BUT auto answer is close to finish, theres one last thing i have to do which is finding the actual answer, im starting to think it's impossible but wish me luck lol
i am a basic javascripter so everything takes time for me

// for auto hit next
tf.nextClick(1) -- This hits the next button
\\
tf.ansClick() - clicks a answer, () should hit the correct ans
if (window.tf) {
    console.log("4 big guys") } - checks if user in test mode/answering questions
